Introduction

      RiSearch - simple but powerful search engine. This script is NOT
meant to replace such powerful search systems like ht://Dig and Glimpse,
and of course it can't compete with commercial software which costs
thousands of dollars. RiSearch intended for small and medium sites with
1000 files and total volume about 10-20Mb. It should be quite enough for
most amateur sites. However, script is powerful enough to work with
much larger number of files.


History

  Ver. 0.99.02 - 30.10.2000 
      Stopword list added. 
      In script output content of META description or content of page can be used. 
      Indexer will not produce errors when it started from brouser as CGI script. 
      Several noncritical bug fixed. 
  Ver. 0.99.01 - 04.09.2000 
      All configurable parameters are now located in separate config.pl file. 
      Added META and IMG ALT tags indexing. 
      Numbers and words with hyphen are now indexed correctly. 
      Added configurable minimum word length. 
      Configurable number of results per page in output. 
      Added support for special characters (like &Egrave; or &x255;). 
      Added list of files, which should not be indexed.



Installation

1.Open the compressed archive you downloaded. Inside you will find
  several files. 

       index.pl   - indexing script
       search.pl  - searching script
       config.pl  - file with all configurable parameters
       header     - header template file
       footer     - footer template file
       searchbox  - sample search box
       readme.txt and readme.rus

2.Put search.pl, config.pl, header and footer files in your CGI directory. 
3.Set permissions of all files/dirs to world-readable world-executable
  (755 for UNIX systems). 
4.config.pl is used both for indexing and searching. Put identical copies
  of it where your index.pl and search.pl files located. 
5.You may edit header and footer files like regular html files to
  customize the look of the results page. 
6.The file searchbox contain sample search form. Edit it and put anywhere
  in your html files.


Indexing

      The file index.pl can be located anywhere in your computer.
Just be sure you can execute it. Edit file config.pl to set several parameters.

  1. $file_ext = '\.(html|txt|htm|shtml)$';  - list of files
    extensions to be indexed. 

  2. $no_index_dir = '(img|image|temp|tmp|cgi-bin)$';  -
    directories, which should not be indexed. 

  3. $base_dir = ".";  - path to the directory, where your html files
    are located. If index.pl located in the same dyrectory, leave this
    variable as is. 

  4. $base_url = "http://www.server.com/";  - URL of your site. 

  5. $FULL_WORD = "NO";  - RiSearch can return a page if keyword
    coincide with the beginning of some word on that page. Or it can
    return results if keyword coincide with any part of any word in a
    page. Say, you choose full word indexing ( $FULL_WORD =
    "YES"; ). In thas case for query "port" will be found words
    "important", "portrait", "sport", "report" and so on. By default
    ( $FULL_WORD = "NO"; ) only word "portrait", "portion",
    "portfolio", "portable" will be found. Full word indexing may
    require about two times more space for database.

  6. There are many other parameters which are self-documented in config.pl file. 

    Change below only if you need multilanguage support. With default
    settings script will work with English and Russian (win1251
    encoding) and most European languages. 

  7. $CAP_LETTERS = '\xC0-\xDF';  - Put here list of capital letters
    of your language (which are different from latin). Do the same for
    small letters and in to_lower_case function.

      After you finish indexing your site, copy all produced files
(hash, hashwords, sitewords, finfo, word_ind) to CGI-BIN directory,
where file search.pl is located.

      Indexing process require a lot of system resources. Your webhosting
provider can be very unhappy, if you will run it too often. Probably, it is
better to index local copy of your site. The parameter  $cgi_bin =
"cgi-bin";  will determine where to create database files. Then just
copy them to the server (please use "BIN" mode). 


Query language

      Keywords should be written with commas or spaces between them.
The case is not important. 
      The search type "AND" means that RiSearch will find files which
contain ALL keywords. The search type "OR" means that script will find
all files which contain at least one keyword. In any search regime mark
"+" before keyword means that this keyword should be in returned pages.
In order to exclude word from results type "-" before keyword, for
example "+perl -CGI". 
      By default script will return any files where it finds the keywords. For
example, if you ask "port", RiSearch will find all pages with words
"port", "important", "portrait", "sport", "report" and so on (look at
"Indexing" guide). If you wish to find exact word, put exclamation mark
after keyword: "port!".
